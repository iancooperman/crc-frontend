Ian is a Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience in IT, supporting one of the largest school districts in the country. He’s developed a knack for solving problems quickly, whether that means repairing hardware on the spot or streamlining day-to-day workflows. Currently, he’s working toward transitioning into software engineering, with the long-term goal of moving into machine learning. At the core, Ian is driven by a desire to build tools and systems that make people’s work simpler and more effective.

This site was developed with Jekyll, a static site generator, using a customized Minimal Mistakes theme. It is hosted on Amazon S3, distributed through CloudFront, and managed with Route 53 for DNS, serving as a demonstration of scalable cloud-based architecture. Continuous integration and deployment are being implemented with AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline to enable automated updates and streamlined workflows.

The long-term goal for this site is to serve as a central hub, bringing together Ian’s work, projects, and writing. In addition to technical content, it will also feature personal reflections and commentary—ranging from thoughtful insights to lighthearted takes on topics that don’t necessarily matter, but are worth sharing.
