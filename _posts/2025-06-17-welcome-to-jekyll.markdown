In case you can't tell from the header, I'm Ian Cooperman. Fun fact: if you Google me, the first result you'll likely see is the LinkedIn page of an "accomplished program manager and scrum master"...based in Florida. That handsome fellow is not me. 

I'm currently an IT Support Technician with the Los Angeles Unified School District. But I'd like to think I'm a little more than that. Even in my day job, I've gone beyond the job description, regularly tinkering with novel productivity software, and even writing some of my own. Whether it's augmenting spreadsheets with Google Apps Script (turning them nearly into full-fledged apps for tracking IT assets), whipping up AutoHotKey scripts to skip repetitive tasks, or building a whole [password generator](https://iancooperman.github.io/salud-secure/) because LAUSD's password policies baffled the people I serve, I spend my days dreaming of automating myself entirely out of a job.

Such a strange coincidence, two Ian Coopermans chasing such oddly parallel careers. But unlike Florida Man, I'm actually available!

Come on in and get acquainted with the 2nd-best Ian Cooperman!
